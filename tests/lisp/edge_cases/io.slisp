;; I/O Tests
;; Tests for: print, display, write, exit
;;
;; Note: These are hard to test automatically since print has side effects
;; and exit terminates the process. These are mostly placeholder tests.

(define io-tests (list
  ;; print returns the value it prints
  ;; (We can't easily test what gets printed, but we can test the return value)
  ;; Note: Commenting these out since print output would clutter test results
  ;; (test 'print-returns-number (assert-eq (print 42) 42))
  ;; (test 'print-returns-symbol (assert-eq (print 'foo) 'foo))
  ;; (test 'print-returns-list (assert-eq (print '(a b c)) '(a b c)))

  ;; display outputs strings without quotes, with newline
  ;; (test 'display-returns-value (assert-eq (display "hello") "hello"))

  ;; write outputs strings without quotes, without newline (for LSP protocol)
  ;; (test 'write-returns-value (assert-eq (write "hello") "hello"))

  ;; Arity checks for write
  (test 'write-arity-zero (assert-error (write)))
  (test 'write-arity-two (assert-error (write "a" "b")))

  ;; Placeholder - we need at least one test
  (test 'io-placeholder (assert-true #t))))

;; TODO: Future I/O tests (when capabilities expand)
;; - read from stdin
;; - file I/O
;; - formatted output
;; - error output stream
